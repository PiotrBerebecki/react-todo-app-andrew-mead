Live version can be seen on [Heroku](Link coming soon). The app sleeps on a free server so you may need to wait a couple of seconds for it to wake up.

The app has been developed by Piotr Berebecki as part of undertaking an excellent course: [The Complete React Web App Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-web-app-developer-course/) by Andrew Mead.

The technologies used include:

* React
* ES6
* Node
* Webpack

* Karma
* Mocha
* Foundation (front-end framework)
* Git
* GitHub
* Heroku
